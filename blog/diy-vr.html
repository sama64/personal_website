        <h1>How to play vr wirelessly with an android, a kinect, and wii remotes (or psmove)</h1>
        <p>¿Will you believe me if i tell you that you can play vr wirelessly with an android, a kinect, and wii remotes at 60hz? I guess you do, because it says it in the title.
        ¿But would you believe me if i tell you can have full body tracking with the same setup? This is the result of my research and pain trying lots of softwares, videos, and making it all work together. <br> <br>
        For starters, ¿What you will you need?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>PC with a GTX 960 or superior</li>
            <li>A windows installation (sadly)</li>
            <li>Kinect 360 (or kinect one, but i recommend the 360)</li>
            <li>Kinect to pc adapter (you can buy one, or diy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phoZXyC4ySU" target="_blank">Click here</a>)</li>
            <li>1/2 wiimotes (or 2 psmove controllers)</li>
            <li>An phone (android/ios)</li>
            <li>Vr box (or any other vr box to do vr with a phone, like a samsung gear vr)</li>
            <li>Bluetooth adapter (or bluetooth support)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Psmove controllers are way better for tracking than wiimotes <br> <br> 
            First we are going to set up our headset without the controllers. For this you can use pretty much every phone. Obviously it will work better if it has good resolution, and a big format. Install the IVRy driver from the app store of your phone. Then go to steam and install it there too. It is a paid software, but it is not expensive, and to my consideration totally worth it for what it offers. Has a free trial though, but after 10 minutes the image only shows in black and white.
             <br> <br>
            Once you have the software installed in both the pc and phone, as well as steamvr, they have to be connected to the same network. Open the app on the phone, and then on the pc. It will connect automatically and start showing the steamvr home. Now just put the phone inside the phone inside your vr box. I will assume that you know how to do that. 
            <br> <br>            
            Something that you may not know tho is the importance of the IPD. IPD stands for inter pupillary distance, and it's something that can be adjusted on most vr boxes. Basically just move the lens adjuster until you can see the image clearly, and make sure it is comfortable. Otherwise you will have nausea pretty quick. If this is adjusted right, most people don’t feel nausea while using the headset in my experience. If you want to get extra comfy you can adjust the image IPD from IVRy settings right-clicking on the icon that appears at the right of the taskbar.
            <br> <br>
            You can connect headphones to your phone and configure IVRy to send the sound to the phone. Now you have a perfectly functioning vr headset that can run any vr game that your pc can handle. That is great, you have it for a fraction of the cost of even the cheapest vr headsets. 
            There is a problem though. It is great for playing games that have compatibility with controllers, but you can’t move in 3d, just rotate. And the worst part is that you can’t interact naturally with your environment. Let’s make it even better.
            <br> <br>
            To the controllers you have 2 options. Wiimotes, or psmove controllers. If you are buying either of these, i strongly recommend you to buy the psmove controllers. Now, it is possible to use the controllers with nothing else but this, a bluetooth adapter, and Driver4VR, but the results are not going to be great. The movement in 3d of the controllers is going to be emulated, and controlled by rotation. It gets frustrating really quickly.
            <br> <br>
            In order to get our controllers to be tracked, we will need a kinect, or if you want better tracking, and you don’t care about full body tracking, just buy a psmove camera. It is also easier to set up. How to setup everything with psmove is covered below. But if you already have wiimotes and do not want to buy psmove controllers, the next section is for you.
            <br> <br> </p>
            <h1>Connecting the Wiimotes</h1>
            <p> To use the wiimotes on steamvr you will need another proprietary software, Driver4VR. It is not very expensive, and has lots of ways to improve the tracking, and support for things like full body tracking with webcam, color tracking, and some very cool features. Install Driver4VR on your pc. 
            <br> <br>
            Then connect the bluetooth adapter if it’s not integrated in your pc. It can be quite tricky to get everything working with the wii remotes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMSPY9DBsSU" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the official tutorial. Ignore the video section about the kinect for now. There is the disadvantage too that they use disposable batteries, and in my experience they last about 2 or 3 days if you use them every day for about 2 or 3 hours.
            <br> <br> </p>
            <h1>PSmove controllers</h1>
            <p>If you are buying these, make sure that the barcode doesn’t start with 4. If it starts with 1 or 2 you are safe. In order to connect them you will need a bluetooth adapter.
            <br> <br>
            If you don’t care about full body tracking, i recommend you to get a psmove camera, or even 2 to improve tracking. And also you don’t need to buy any more software. The thing with this is that you are going to have to handle your head position another way. One way of doing it is to put a led inside a colored ping pong ball, and stick it to one or two batteries. Also a way of sticking that to the headset would be needed. To configure the psmove cameras watch <a href="https://youtu.be/lJyIHCMDINA" target="_blank">this video</a>. And to make the headset tracker <a href="https://youtu.be/ChXU9optQYA" target="_blank">this one</a>. 
            <br> <br>
            If you are going to use kinect follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_JvxM-_rRA" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>, and don’t mind the kinect section of the video until later on if you are going to use it. It is more simple to setup.
            <br> <br> </p>
            <h1>Kinect</h1>

            <p> The kinect will allow you to have full body tracking, and most importantly, track your body to determine the controllers and headset position. I recommend you to get the 360 version, because it has some compatibility issues with the drivers. The downside is that the 360 version only supports 30fps, while the kinect one supports up to 60, and has less latency. But if your pc is not great, and it probably isn’t if you are making this setup that doesn’t care, because it would reduce the performance significantly. 
            <br> <br>
            USB 3.0 and beyond is desirable, but i personally tried it in USB 2.0 and worked just fine. You would need an adapter for the kinect in order to connect to the pc. You can buy one, but that is kind of boring. The cool way is to get a 12v 1.08a (or 1a) power supply, and make the connections with the kinect cable. Also connect that with a USB male, and you are ready. It is actually more simple than it sounds. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phoZXyC4ySU" target="_blank">Here</a> is a tutorial on how to do it.
            <br> <br>
            Once you have your adapter, plug it into the usb, and plug the power supply. You will need to install the drivers of the kinect. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link. If Driver4VR ask you for more drivers it will give you a link to install them. Now open steamvr, and it will automatically start IVRy and D4VR. For wiimotes, go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMSPY9DBsSU" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> in 5:40 to configure the kinect and wiimotes. If you are using PSmove it is fairly similar, the configuration is kind of the same. Go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_JvxM-_rRA" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> on 6:30.
            <br> <br> <br> <br>
            
            If you worked your way out of the installations, and configurations, congratulations. It wasn’t that easy, but now you have your full vr setup with 6-dof and full body tracking complete (Maybe). Now you can just install any vr game that your pc can handle, run it, and have some fun. I recommend The Lab to test things. If you sticked until the end, thanks. I hope this has been helpful. I tried a lot of painful to setup software before nailing it with this setup.
